Things TO DO:

- Get command - this is crazy!
- Server:
    a) Script for cleaning database unused sessions (SQL Proc?)
    b) Entries in MongoDB should have following attributes:
        clientGUID, IP Address, Port, Date Joined, Last Accessed, Hits, Last Heartbeat, NumberFilesShared
- Scripts for quick testing and few scenarios for MR DR to run them
- Scripts for installation (create default shared dir, symlink for binary, etc)
- Scripts for Daemon:
    a) Should check periodically if daemon is running
    b) Should also check if the repository state exists and it's readable
    c) Should be able to Start/Stop/Restart Daemon
