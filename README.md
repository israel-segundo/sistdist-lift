## Synopsis

LIFT is a file sharing system for local networks that provides a quick way of setting up a file sharing infrastructure.

This is the final project for our Distributed Systems course. This course is 
part of the Master in Computer Sciences imparted in ITESM Guadalajara, Mexico.

## Motivation

We were inspired and curious about distributed systems that made a real difference in our field and in the world. Systems like Napster, BitTorrent and GNUtella.

Napster and GNUtella were analyzed from a technical point of view and some of its techniques served as base for our system
